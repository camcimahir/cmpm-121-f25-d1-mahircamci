# CMPM 121 D1 Project

I got inspiration from benho612 adding the floating +1 on the screen when clicking the fire button. In my code it is in src/main.ts and the function spawnFloaty. Here is a link to his project repository: <https://github.com/benho612/CMPM1212-D1-Assignement>

I got the idea of shirnking and streching my main button from TheSkyIsForward2. In my code you can see this addition in src/style.css. Here is the link to his project repository: <https://github.com/TheSkyIsForward2/CMPM121IncrementalGame>
